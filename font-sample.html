    <h1 class="font-sample-h1">Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h1>    
    <h4 class="font-sample-h4">By William Shakespeare</h4>
    <p class="font-sample-p">
      Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
      And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
      Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
      And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
      And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
      By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
      But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
      Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
      Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
      When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
      So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
      So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
    </p>
